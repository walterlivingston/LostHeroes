This is a mod for the Java Edition of Minecraft that adds elements of Greek Mythology to the game based on Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus series.

The main premise of the mod is that when you first join your world, you will be claimed by one of the 12 major gods and goddesses on Mt. Olympus.  This will imbue you with a power based on their aspects.  The mod also adds new tools, metals, and items.  In future releases, it will also add new mobs and dimensions to the game.

**Now jump in and be a hero!**
